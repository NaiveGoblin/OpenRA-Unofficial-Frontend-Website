# OpenRA---Unofficial-Frontend-Website
This is an unofficial frontend website for OpenRA, built as a personal portfolio project using Node.js and Bootstrap. The goal is to create a modern, responsive user interface that showcases information about the OpenRA project, including downloads, game features, and community links.
